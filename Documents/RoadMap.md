Competitive Programming Roadmap (Python, 16 Weeks)

Language: Python
Daily Time Commitment: 30 minutes
Total Duration: ~16 weeks (4 months)
Outcome: Strong DSA foundation, improved problem-solving speed, contest readiness

Daily 30–Minute Practice Structure (Mandatory)

Every day follows the same discipline-focused routine:

Time	Activity
5 min	Review concept / pattern
20 min	Solve 1–2 problems
5 min	Optimize + note mistakes

Discipline matters more than the number of problems solved.
